Codecademy Intermediate Python 3 OOP lesson on **`super()`** in dataclass syntax with Enum

Enum requires at least Python 3.4 to run the file. Here is the link to documentation: [enum — Support for enumerations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html)

Dataclasses were first introduced in Python 3.7. They can be backported to Python 3.6 by running **`pip install dataclasses`**.

Here is list of links with more info:

- Official documentation: [dataclasses — Data Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#module-dataclasses)
- Backport: [dataclasses 0.8](https://pypi.org/project/dataclasses/)
- Real Python article: [Data Classes in Python 3.7+ (Guide)](https://realpython.com/python-data-classes/)

The use of the **`slots=True`** and **`kw_only=True`** keyword arguments in the `@dataclass` decorator requires Python 3.10.

The use of the **`StrEnum`** in the enum class requires Python 3.11.
